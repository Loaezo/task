This repository includes only two small scripts:

`missing.py` includes two functions:

`missing_elements_0`: The complexity is O(n^2), as it loops over both lists.
`missing_elements_1`: Converts the second list to a set for faster looping. Uses a generator and a ternary to return the elements. The complexity is O(n), as it only iterates over one of the losts

`remove_zeros.py` includes a function that returns the same list with the zeros removed, using only O(1) of extra space.
